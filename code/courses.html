                        and use Structured Query Language (SQL) to create, modify and query a database. Students design and create 
                        databases that are maintainable, secure and adaptable to change in business requirements, using normalization. 
                        Students become familiar with the functions of a Database Management System (DBMS) and its components in 
                        comparison with legacy systems and alternative information storage mechanisms.

                        further study in the field. Students develop introductory knowledge of computer programming with emphasis on 
                        problem analysis and design, using algorithms, pseudocode, flowcharts, UML Class Diagrams and testing, with 
                        the Java programming language used as a means to implement problem solution designs. Through an introduction
                         to the Java programming language students use sequential structures, selection structures, repetition structures, 
                         variables, constants, methods, constructors, one-dimensional arrays, object-oriented programming, classes, 
                         objects, abstraction, encapsulation, inputs, outputs, coding conventions and documentation. Theory is 
                         reinforced with application by means of practical laboratory assessments.

                        Students investigate computer number systems in addition to Boolean algebra and logic to help solve problems involving computer systems. 
                        Students also study the addition and subtraction of vectors using vector components. Delivered in a modular format, this course is equivalent 
                        to the completion of all of the following math modules MAT8100 - A, B, C, D, E, F, and L.

                        structures, process management, storage management, installation, configuration, and administration both in theory and through practical assignments based on the GNU/Linux 
                        operating system. Lab work is designed to implement the theory by developing skills using the powerful GNU/Linux command-line tools and utilities.
